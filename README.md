# Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM

This project predicts future stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model trained on historical price data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Keras (TensorFlow backend)  
- Matplotlib  

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Normalized time-series data and structured sequences for LSTM input
- Built and trained a deep LSTM model for one-step prediction
- Achieved low RMSE and good trend alignment with actual prices
- Visualized prediction accuracy using line plots

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy tensorflow matplotlib


2. Run lstm_stock_forecast.ipynb in Jupyter or Colab.
